# TickTick Task Creator for Obsidian

[!NOTE]
> This plugin is in an early planning phase.
> I expect to begin development sometime this summer. First release may be in early fall.

TickTick Task Creator will allow you to create tasks in [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/) based on your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes.

## Features

- Create TickTick tasks that link to your Obsidian notes, and add a link to the created task in note properties.
- Control TickTick task attributes based on note properties
  - Configure associations between task attributes and frontmatter properties in plugin settings
  - Set attributes using TickTick Quick Add syntax within Obsidian
- Update a task associated with a note when note properties are edited

## Scope

I'm creating this plugin primarily for my own use. At present, I only plan to implement simple features that I find essential to my own workflow. Bidirectional or TickTick â†’ Obsidian sync is not currently on the roadmap.

Once I've released an MVP, I'd be happy to consider PRs and feature requests.
